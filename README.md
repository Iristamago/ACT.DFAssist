# ACT.DFAssist

Final Fantasy XIV DFAssist forked plug-in for **ACT3**

*Duty roulette packets seem to be **obfuscated** since version 5.2. And I couldn't decode them. Sorry :(
Other features like notifications and FATEs infomations are still work good.*

If you don't need FATEs infos and notification, *try another version of DFAssist* - https://github.com/qitana/ACT_DFAPlugin This is an overlay layer for ngld overlay. :)

## Feature
* Supported game client: Version **5.2** and **below**
* Assist both **duty instances** and **FATEs & Eureka**

## Install
First, copy **plugin file**(ACT.DFAssist.dll) to your plugin directory. Second, add copied plugin to your list
